(Note: this broiler also has a version with MaterialUi)

This is a simple broiler plate made with create-react-app.
It includes, TypeScript, eslint, and prettier.

The linting script will:
a.) run eslint rules
b.) run prettier and reformat the code based on the eslint rules.

The broilerplate also has the vscode configurations to run eslint and prettier on saving changes to files.
In case this feature isn't working, you may need to check that the vscode configutions are set.
see : https://linuxhint.com/enable-linting-eslint-visual-studio-code/ under the section: # How to Enable Linting on Save

In the terminal, simply run:

<<<<<<< HEAD
# Run eslint

# `npm run lint`

# Run Pretrier

# `npm run format`

# ESLINT

## Material Ui

A theme provider is included and a styled component for the LandingContainer which can be found in src/components/Landing/styled.
Both of these pieces are in the boiler plate to show which props do what.
